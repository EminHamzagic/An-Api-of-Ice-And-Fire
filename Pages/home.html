      <h1 class="title">Something about the series</h1>
      <p>
        A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of epic fantasy novels by the
        American novelist and screenwriter George R. R. Martin. He began writing
        the first volume, A Game of Thrones, in 1991, publishing it in 1996.
        Martin originally envisioned the series as a trilogy but has released
        five out of a planned seven volumes. The fifth and most recent entry in
        the series, A Dance with Dragons, was published in 2011. Martin
        continues to write the sixth novel, titled The Winds of Winter. A
        seventh novel, A Dream of Spring, is planned to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Song of Ice and Fire depicts a violent world dominated by political
        realism. What little supernatural power that remains is confined to the
        margins of the known world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The novels are set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos.
        The story unfolds through a rotating set of subjective points of view,
        the success or survival of any one of which is never assured. Each
        chapter is told from a limited third-person perspective, drawn from a
        group of characters that grows from nine in the first novel to 31 by the
        fifth.

      <p>
        In Westeros ultimate power derives from the King on the Iron Throne and
        descends through the Great Houses that rule the constituent regions of
        the continent to their vassals. There are nine Great Houses, and each of
        them have a number of vassal houses (sometimes also referred to as
        lesser houses) in their liege.
